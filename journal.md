# Date 1.16.25 - Subject: What I've worked on and learned this week

I just finished an assignment for my C++ class, 3005. The assignment took a while because of a syntax error that was breaking everything, but I eventually found it and now it passes all the tests for this assignment. 

This week I've been getting back into making behavior packs for bedrock Minecraft, and through doing so it has really made an impression on how important it is to document your code well so others can understand it, especially when making a modding API for a video game. They fairly frequently update the way the modpack's code functions, which wouldn't be so huge of an issue, but they do not document the changes very well, causing function to stop working, with a new alternative that has been made, but not documented about, making it essentially non existent. 

Though by learning some Molang (*Minecraft's scripting language*) I learned how to properly use ternary conditional operators, so that's cool, I like how compact they are.
